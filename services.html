                    <p>By and large, braces can be classified into three types; ceramic and plastic and metal brackets
                        that
                        are fixed by the dentists in front of the teeth. These brackets are chiefly glued to hold the
                        wire
                        in place, which is typically shaped to an optimal contour by the dentists. In due course of
                        time,
                        the wire keeps on shifting the teeth in place, thus your crooked teeth are corrected. A monthly
                        visit to the dental clinic is required so as to make the wire tightened. Among three
                        alternatives
                        available for braces, the dentist mostly prefers to use ceramic brackets because of its
                        transparent
                        color, which hardly makes them noticeable. Moreover, the ceramic brackets usually commix with
                        the
                        natural color of the teeth. After the braces are removed, the patients need to wear a retainer
                        for
                        few months in order to prevent the teeth from shifting.</p>

                    <p>If you have been living with the embarrassment of one missing tooth and are in dire need to get a
                        perfect solution, then single tooth implants are one of the best choices that the modern dental
                        implant process has developed in recent times. Single tooth implants are the most beneficial
                        implant
                        option for patients who have recently lost one or more tooth in an accident or injury and want
                        to
                        get single dental implants to replace the space. In terms of functionality, dental implants can
                        stay
                        intact for at least 10-12 years without calling for any specific medical attention.

                        In dental cases, wherein multiple teeth are missing in different parts of the several single
                        teeth,
                        implants are excellent replacement restoration. Multiple tooth implants provide a strong base to
                        the
                        spaces of the missing tooth inside the patientâ€™s mouth. As for the cases of those individuals

                    <p>Bright and shiny teeth is desirable by one and all. People with discolored teeth often lose some
                        great opportunities in their life and also lack in confidence. The bright and shiny teeth surely
                        increase the confidence level as well as your persona. So, people always try different methods
                        to
                        keep their teeth white and bright. But these methods of teeth whitening never provide a
                        guarantee
                        and total safety to your teeth.</p>

                    <p class="zg">Crowns and Bridges</p>
                    <p>Crowns, also known as caps, restore damaged teeth and imitates the shape, size and color of the
                        surrounding teeth. Crowns are indicated for cracked teeth and teeth with deep cavities. To put
                        it
                        simply, they are to protect teeth that have been filled by root-canal treatment; to provide
                        extra
                        support for bridges; and to cover poorly shaped or discolored teeth. Crowns may be made of
                        metal,
                        porcelain, or newer restorative materials like metal free ceramics. They are custom-made and
                        fitted
                        for each patient in accordance with the size and length of the natural teeth. Crowns typically
                        last
                        five to eight years, but can last much longer with proper oral hygiene. Crowns can be made of a
                        variety of materials. They can be made of plastic, ceramic or metal alloys. A combination of
                        metal
                        and ceramic is also possible to maximize strength and simulate the appearance of natural teeth.

                    <p>A small decay in enamel or dentin may or may not cause sensitivity or pain. However, the pulp is
                        the
                        most sensitive part of the tooth as it is connected to nerves and blood vessels. As and when the
                        pulp is exposed to the outer atmosphere either due to decay or an injury, you are likely to
                        experience tremendous pain. This is exactly when a Root Canal Treatment comes to the rescue of
                        your
                        tooth. Through RCT, the pain can be completely eliminated without extracting the tooth. The four
                        stages of Root Canal Treatment are cleaning i.e. the infected pulp is removed using manual or
                        mechanized files. The inner walls of dentin are cleaned and filled with antiseptics to prevent
                        relapse of infections. The second stage is shaping wherein the root canal is prepared for root
                        filling by using files. The third stage takes care of the filling the root canal with artificial
                        materials such as guttapurcha etc. Then, the hollowness of the tooth, which reduces its
